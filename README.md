# Android Development Shell Tools
 * Project created by [Adrian DC](https://github.com/AdrianDC) - 2015-2017

 * The 'android_development_shell_tools' is a project meant to provide
   <br />
   multiple advanced functions and shortcuts to ease Android development

 * The sources written and shared here are either meant to be used as they are,
   <br />
   or to serve as a reference for commands and functions an Android developer needs

 * To keep a local sync of 'android_development_shell_tools' updated with upstream changes,
   <br />
   simply run the *`shtoolssync`* command and the updates will be downloaded

 * Scripts flagged "Standalone Import Ready" and starting with *`source <(curl -Ls...`*
   <br />
   are able to be directly sourced through the provided commands in any terminal
   <br />
   without the need of this project being synced locally or loaded in a root context

 * The "extensions/" folder can hold self-coded scripts folders based on the scripts from
   <br />
   'android_development_shell_tools' and be included along the regular ones.
   <br />
   These scripts will not be lost with 'shtoolssync' and will stay in "extensions/".
   <br />
   *(Keeping a copy or symlinking extensions scripts is recommended for safety)*
